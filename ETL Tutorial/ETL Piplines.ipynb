replace parts of a string with another string. If you know the exact string you're looking for, the replace() method is straight forward. For example, say you wanted to remove the string '(Trial)' from this data:\n","\n","| data                     |\n","|--------------------------|\n","| '(Trial) Banking'        |\n","| 'Banking'                |\n","| 'Farming'                |\n","| '(Trial) Transportation' |\n","\n","You could use `df['data'].replace('(Trial'), '')` to replace (Trial) with an empty string.\n","\n","### regular expressions\n","What about this data?\n","\n","| data                                           |\n","|------------------------------------------------|\n","| 'Other Industry; Trade and Services?$ab' |\n","| 'Other Industry; Trade and Services?ceg' |\n","\n","This type of data is trickier. In this case, there's a pattern where you want to remove a string that starts with an exclamation point and then has an unknown number of characters after it. When you need to match patterns of character, you can use [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).\n","\n","The replace method can take a regular expression. So\n","df['data'].replace('?.+', regex=True) where '?.+' means find a set of characters that starts with a question mark is then followed by one or more characters. You can see a [regular expression cheat sheet](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285) here.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AejBg-9GpMaL"},"source":["## Finding Outliers\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":55,"metadata":{"id":"xjKITeX4pMaL","outputId":"3347f5bc-98a4-467e-d9c1-368c28e41196","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680621231426,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":257,"user":{"displayName":"Or Perets","userId":"18009966981585565071"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["     App_Id                           AppName      Price            Geners  \\\n","0         0             10 Best Foods for You   0.000000  Health & Fitness   \n","1         1  104 找工作 - 找工作 找打工 找兼職 履歷健檢 履歷診療室   0.194687                 .   \n","2         2                              11st   0.000000          Shopping   \n","3         3        1800 Contacts - Lens Store   0.000000           Medical   \n","4         4   1LINE – One Line with One Touch   0.000000             Board   \n","..      ...                               ...        ...               ...   \n","641     629                    E*TRADE Mobile   0.000000           Finance   \n","642     630                   EMT Review Plus  11.990000           Medical   \n","643     631     EMT Tutor NREMT-B Study Guide   3.990000           Medical   \n","644     632                 EMT-B Pocket Prep   0.000000           Medical   \n","645     633     ES File Explorer File Manager   0.000000      Productivity   \n","\n","               Category    Rating  Rating_Count  \n","0    Health And Fitness  4.000000  7.785448e+06  \n","1                     .  4.319059  7.785448e+06  \n","2              Shopping  3.800000  7.785448e+06  \n","3               Medical  4.700000  7.785448e+06  \n","4                  Game  4.600000  4.821550e+05  \n","..                  ...       ...           ...  \n","641             Finance  3.900000  7.785448e+06  \n","642             Medical  4.500000  7.785448e+06  \n","643             Medical  4.600000  7.785448e+06  \n","644             Medical  4.500000  7.785448e+06  \n","645        Productivity  4.600000  7.785448e+06  \n","\n","[646 rows x 7 columns]"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-26603523-7880-4830-9c27-45d487e30b57\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>App_Id</th>\n","      <th>AppName</th>\n","      <th>Price</th>\n","      <th>Geners</th>\n","      <th>Category</th>\n","      <th>Rating</th>\n","      <th>Rating_Count</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>10 Best Foods for You</td>\n","      <td>0.000000</td>\n","      <td>Health &amp;
