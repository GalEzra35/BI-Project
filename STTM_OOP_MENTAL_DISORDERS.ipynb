Maybe Iâ€™m just an anxious and sensitive person? Iâ€™ve even gone so far as wondering if iâ€™m fact, what I really have is a really bad case of ADHD. But itâ€™s awful moments of realisation like this, is when I truly realise. Yeh. I have BPD. Fuck. \\n\\nI always have struggled with my sense of identity, but itâ€™s particularly when Iâ€™m in relationships that I really feel lost. I always feel like Iâ€™m not who I really am, or want to be. Iâ€™m not ME. I always feel like relationships changes me in a way where it just terrifies me, because I donâ€™t recognise myself anymore; I donâ€™t like how my habits and mannerisms change. It even affects what I like and donâ€™t like, down to really small things such as what clothes I wear, and how I do my make up. This is an awful cycle and I donâ€™t know how to escape it. \\n\\nI met this amazing man a few months ago. I really love and care about him; he makes me so happy. This is probably the healthiest relationship Iâ€™ve ever been in, and I really feel as though he is special. But the bad thoughts have crept in again, like they always do. I feel terrified that Iâ€™m not the same person I was when I met him. Iâ€™ve changed how I look, I donâ€™t do the hobbies I used to have and I donâ€™t have the same energy like I used to. Fair enough to the last point though, because this pandemic has probably changed everyoneâ€™s mental energy. But still. I feel it and itâ€™s on my mind. \\n\\nWhy do I always do this? Why canâ€™t I just fucking accept something that is actually good in my life, and just let go of this bullshit response to getting close to someone? Like honestly, what am I even scared of? He loved me how I was then and how I am now. Why canâ€™t this be enough? \\n\\nIsnâ€™t that the sad truth though, that love just sometimes isnâ€™t enough, when talking about mental health. \\n\\nSo here I am. Terrified that Iâ€™ll somehow sabotage my relationship by trying to regain my identity through chaotic and impulsive actions. I just know itâ€™ll happen. \\n\\nI want to change and just you know, chill out? I internalise so much of my BPD (didnâ€™t used to lol) that I just feel really alone with how I feel. I mean, how can I even explain it to him? â€œHi I know everything is going really good but because I have a fucking problem, I canâ€™t help but create a crisis for myself. Iâ€™m going to just go, move away to another city and disappear for a few months, just so I can find myself again. Even though logically people change all the time and how I feel as though Iâ€™ve changed isnâ€™t really that significant in the grand scheme of things. Doesnâ€™t matter that that will end up damaging my mental health further but I lack the coping mechanisms to deal with my shit. Iâ€™m sorry please donâ€™t hate me.â€\\x9d\\n\\nI know this all just sounds so pointless and such a non problem. Me 2 years ago was classic BPD whereby I couldnâ€™t help but externalise all of my problems and thoughts (itâ€™s taken me a lot of therapy books to get me to where I am today). \\n\\nI just want to get this off my chest more than anything.\\n\\nOh and just to say, I am going try my fucking best to fight how I feel.

Like around a few months I've been hooking up with a lot of people, having one night stands and all. But before these one night stands I was a virgin for whole 22 years, I avoided sex bc of my traumas until now. And the minute I started having sex, I fell for the person I hooked up with first. It became a regular thing for us and I really want to have more with them but they're actually really uninterested in me as a person (they are emotionally distant) and it's like I get hurt and triggered by everything they do now. I become so upset I'm triggered 24/7 and I started self harm after stopping for like 2 years ago. It's affecting me too badly about alcohol and other substance addictions as well because I can't stand being sober and thinking about them.\\nAt first I really saw them as the person I needed the most, but now I can't help but getting so mad at them for every single thing they do. I don't talk about this out loud with them (sometimes I suck at hiding tho) but I internalize the whole anger instead and blame myself for being unloveable all the time. I feel like the best thing I can do is to stop seeing them altogether but it's also not something I can do because even though I'm mad I can't stay away from them or stop thinking about them. Any advice would be fine, I just want to get through this without losing my mind even more:(\",\n",

Others could see the problem but I couldnâ€™t. I still donâ€™t fully. \\n\\nWhile it feels good to understand why I feel the way I feel, the more I learn about BPD, the more uneasy I feel. I feel like almost every single aspect of who I am is a reflection of my BPD. \\n\\nFor example, I love to shop. I always joke that its my only hobby, but I tend to spend excessively. I have no savings. I often live paycheck to paycheck because I spend most of what I have. I have a favorite stuffed animal that Iâ€™ve had since I was 5 (Iâ€™m 27 now) that I sleep with every night. She is my most prized possession and I would give up everything, even my cats who I love dearly, before I would give her up. I am so attached to this thing that I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™d do if I lost her, she got destroyed, etc. \\n\\nThese are just two examples, but I feel like itâ€™s like this with every part of me. I hate that the things that brought me joy and comfort are symptoms of my illness. \\n\\nI know logically that itâ€™s not true, but I feel like I am all BPD.

But I get so crazy and evil when he aks me if he can go out with them...and he suffers a lot, obviously. I tried so hard to change my behaviour but I just can\\'t help it. I only want him for myself. I\\'d lock him up in a room forever where only I can see him if I could. I\\'m not in the position to seek help right now. I don\\'t want to suffer so much anymore and I don\\'t want him to suffer either. Should I break up with him for our own good?',\n",

Itâ€™s more a vent than a need for a perspective but that would help a lot too.\\n\\nIn 2019, I met a guy on tinder when I was visiting another country. Long story short, after complicated decisions, we finally was in a relationship after a year of being friends. We were together for more than a year. At the beginning, everything was amazing even though we were doing long-distance. I have met him and stayed over at his place countless times when we were still friends so we pretty much knew each other very well. He was my soulmate and even became my FP a little after meeting. Somewhere in the middle of our relationship, my symptoms were just appearing stronger and stronger and by that I mean thinking he is going to leave me, being super upset over minor things that would trigger me, crying to bed at night because of how lonely I felt even though we just FaceTimed and we were normally talking etc. Basically all the good stuff that comes with having BPD lol. \\n\\nFast forward to about 2 weeks ago, I wrote my final letter (I would sometimes get emotions so intense that Iâ€™d impulsively write letters on google doc to send him and itâ€™s mostly the same issues and how I was feeling about us) and that just did it for him I guess. He called me that night and cried, telling me how he couldnâ€™t do this anymore and that weâ€™re breaking up. He said different reasons as to why and itâ€™s mostly related to healing ourselves separately. Heâ€™d say, â€œfocus on yourself.â€\\x9d Needless to say, I fell into a deep one-week depressive state where after genuinely wanting to off myself. We are still friends now but I still constantly ponder about why he wanted to break up with my so suddenly. He also said that he was getting exhausted from trying to take care of someone(me) who doesnâ€™t seem to want to help themselves (me). He has his own issues as well being a newly out-of-the-closet trans guy and I also used to try to make him feel comfortable about himself and generally happy. I still worry about him about it and thatâ€™s one thing that makes sense why he also said he wanted me-time after we broke up. He even said heâ€™s thought about it for a while which crushed me even more. Anyway, now whenever I think of the reason why he would want to break up, this is my thought(s). â€œIf he is okay with being alone now barely texting me, does that mean that when he used to call me a lot was all just fake?â€\\x9d â€œDid he want to break up with me so badly just because he wanted to be alone?â€\\x9d â€œWas I just being used for his entertainment?â€\\x9d â€œWhy does he want to get so far away from me right after we broke up? Is it because he is disgusted with me and hates me?â€\\x9d\\n\\nAfter being with him and listening to all his promises about how he was never going to leave and him even talking about marriage once early on and always talking about how we are going to decorate our place in the future which is all what I truly believed and trusted him for saying, I PHYSICALLY cannot trust anyone for their words anymore and that makes the world for me look very hopeless. I feel even more broken than before, though I have started therapy again and am actively trying to think positively about myself now, but this situation is still so fresh to me and I constantly think about it everyday. I mean imagine having a â€œhappyâ€\\x9d relationship and suddenly being broken up with so brutally and also being pushed away by the person who used to want to call you multiple times a day. Itâ€™s so hard for me to wrap my head around. Is it just me? \\n\\nThatâ€™s my story. Iâ€™m still trying to get through it everyday and Iâ€™m actively finally trying to seek for and actually work on getting the treatment that Iâ€™ve been needing for the longest time.

Sometimes I feel like she manipulates me with little things to test the limits of my boundaries. When I donâ€™t magically predict her thoughts she distances herself and gives me the silent treatment for a while, and after she realizes Iâ€™m not crawling after her, she pouts and starts talking again. I hate this so much and itâ€™s what started the splitting. I have tried to talk to her about these things and she just apologizes and promises to do better but thereâ€™s no change.

Iâ€™m 30, male, gay, and I was raised by a sociopath (father) and covert NPD (mother). \\nAbout 2 months ago I went to work and the day really started like any other day. But oh did it quickly turn 180. Half way through my shift I let my manager know i was starting to feel unwell and needed to go home. It was probably taken as a physical illness, which I did not mean. One way or the other I got my way and went home. There, I decided that that was the day when im gonna empty the three bottles of wine I had at home along with an entire month worth of sleeping pills and sedatives. Upon taking it all i thought to myself that it would be a pity to die without addressing my trauma and the reasons why ive been having suicide attempts every so often ever since i turned 6. Long story short I called my mother (the only parent i had contact with, i havenâ€™t spoken to my father in about 10-12 years). That did not go well. Anyway, my finace finished work too early that day and found me too soon. He called the ambulance, i was taken in to the a&amp;e. My stomach was pumped and off they sent me home the next day. I havent really spoken to her since. I did let my mother know i was alive after all and that im not done trying to eventually become successful at killing myself. \\n\\nCircling back to the topic- ever since then i feel expired. I cant find a place for myself in this world, whether its home or work. I was supposed to die that day. Nothing makes sense anymore. Everything feels like an effort so bad id rather strangle myself. \\n\\nPeople would talk to me- i snap. Why are they even making a sound? \\n\\nI have to do my groceries- the fuck is this i asked to no longer need groceries. \\n\\nI go out- why are the people fucking there why is it so fucking warm and why is my body sweating. \\n\\nAll those things just suddenly feel so unbearable, complete deal breakers, for when it comes to my relationship with life. \\n\\nI feel expired because i was supposed to die.

Iâ€™m also having a hard time not splitting on him and seeing this as another one of his selfish, self absorbed, impulsive, shitty behaviors that we are constantly rehashing in marriage counseling.**\\n\\nIdk the whole thing feels petty- and its the least of my/our problems, but itâ€™s just another thing to top the shit cake and Iâ€™m still really struggling not to spiral over the bigger picture of the situation.
